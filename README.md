PyCity Schools Analysis
In this python script we leverage pandas library to evaluate student academic scores and budgets for a school district comprised of fifteen schools.

Two sets of related data sets are merged and used to find the a general summary of the district's key metrics.

Total Schools
Total Students
Total Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
Percentage of Students wtih passing scores (both categories)

We break down the data further to show categories and key metrics grouped by each school in the district.

Students per school
Budget per school
Budget per student (per school)
Average math score per school
Average reading score per school
Percentage/Rate of passing math score per school
Percentage/Rate of passing reading score per school

The data is then used to analyze the data further, showing

Highest and lowest performing schools by overall passing rate.
Math scores by grade per school.
Reading scores by grade per school.

The data is then categorized by school spending budgets into seperate bin ranges.

Then again, similarly, metric scores are categorized by school size and by school type seperately.


The analysis suggests the Charter school type produced higher passing scores than District school type.

Additionally, schools that spent more per student showed to have a lower overall passing rate than schools with a lower budget per student.
